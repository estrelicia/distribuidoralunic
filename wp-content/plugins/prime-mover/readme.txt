== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes Prime Mover unique to other existing migration and backup plugins? =

* The free version has no restrictions on package size, number of websites, or migration mode (single-site or multisite will work). (Note: Exporting/Restoring a multisite main site is a PRO feature)
* The free version supports WordPress multisite migration on any number of subsites, except that exporting/restoring the multisite main site is a PRO feature.
* It can back up WordPress multisite sub-sites or migrate multisite.
* No need to delete your WordPress installation, create/delete the database, and all other technical stuff. It will save you a lot of time.
* This is not hosting-dependent. Prime Mover is designed to work with any hosting company you choose.
* The free version has full multisite migration functionality, usually missing in most migration plugins' free versions.
* Full versatility—migrate from your local host dev site or from a live site to another live site.
* The entire migration will be done inside the WordPress admin. Anyone with administrator access can do it. Hiring a freelancer to do the job is unnecessary and will save you money.
* You won't have to mess with complicated migration settings; the free version has built-in settings. You can choose only a few options to export and migrate—that's it.
* You can save, download, delete, and migrate packages using the management page.
* No need to worry about PHP configuration and server settings. Compatible with most default PHP server settings, even in limited shared hosting.
* Prime Mover works with modern PHP versions 5.6 to 8.5+ (Google Drive feature requires at least PHP 7.4).
* The code follows PHP-fig coding standards (standard PHP coding guidelines).
* The free version supports backup and restoration of non-UTF8 sites. However, you need the PRO version to migrate non-UTF8 to the UTF8 (utf8mb4) database charset and vice versa.
* After migration, you don't need to worry about setting up users or changing passwords. It does not overwrite existing site users.
